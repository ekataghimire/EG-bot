    Mental health refers to a person's overall psychological well-being. It includes a wide range of factors that affect how individuals feel, think, and behave, such as their emotions, thoughts, behaviors, and relationships. Good mental health is essential for leading a happy and fulfilling life, as it allows individuals to cope with the normal stresses of life, work productively, and contribute to their communities.
    </p><p></p>
    There are various types of mental health disorders, ranging from anxiety and depression to personality and eating disorders. These disorders can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life, as they can cause distress, impair daily functioning, and even lead to physical health problems. It's important to understand that mental health disorders are common and treatable, and seeking help is a sign of strength and resilience.
